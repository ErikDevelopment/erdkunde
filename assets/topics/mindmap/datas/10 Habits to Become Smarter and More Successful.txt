10 Habits to Become Smarter and More Successful
	Invest in Real Connections
		Oxytocin calms the brain, reduce cortisol, better sleep, heart health, increased blood flow, more memory and plasticity, prevent cancer
		Releases Oxytocin (Not Possible through SM) 
		Oxytocin is the love/cuddle chemical
	Stay Hydrated
	Secure Nutrition 
		Lions Mane Mushroom (Medicinal)
			Make tea/coffee out of it (energy boost)
			Essential for hippo campus plasticity (learning and growth)
		Stop Consuming Added Sugar
			Main Source:
				Soda & Aerated Drinks
		Nutrients for neurological health:
			Green & Leafy Vegetables (1-2 servings daily)
				Cabbage
				Kale
				Spinach
				Beet Greens
		Pineapple Juice
		Avoid any food that has a label
	Be Mindful of Social Media
		Takes you away from God (you don't remember God)
		Prevents us from looking within for our joy, our values, purpose, makes us feel incomplete (like there's something's missing)
		artificial, fake people out (keep your circle small but valuable)
		Reason?
			several engineers working to keep us hooked (don't let that happen)
			Strong feedback loop (we seek, we find)
			Release dopamine (good but excess is bad)
			Rewards (pleasure)
			So we need to find something even when there's nothing because we need the reward
		Comparison Kills
		Positives of limiting use:
			Less anxiety, depression, FOMO (fear of missing out)
			Take back control (nothing, no one's opinion holding you back)
			Feel more satisfied with life (love yourself more)
		Don't start your day reacting to other's problems
		Attention residue (difficult to concentrate again)
	 Omega 3 (> 2 grams daily)
		Critical part of the fatty membrane which makes the neurons in your brain.
		Sources:
			Egg - yolk
			Fish Oil
			At least 1 seafood meal per week
			Fatty Fish
				Mackerel
				Salmon
				Sardines
			Plants sources:
				Walnuts
				Flax seeds
				Beans
				Blueberries
				Algal Oil
	Enrich environment
		Also enrich work-space
		You are what you eat, drink, breathe, think
		Surround yourself with smart and successful people
		Soon your brain waves will start to sync (good for you)
	Go with your gut (microbiol)
		SSRI - make sure serotonin is not metabolized (antidepressant)
		Got more neural tissue than any other body part (after brain)
		Its your second brain
		responsible for producing several neurotransmitters related to brain health (80% of serotonin - happiness/feel-good chemical)
		Gut and brain connected via vagus nerve
		Your gut determines a lot that happens with your brain and cognitive function
	Learn something new (intentionally) 
		Create something
		Podcast
		Read
		Audiobooks
		Brain workout
	Sleep
		More prone to cyberloafing
		Logical mind (prefrontal cortex) shuts down
		Reduced sleep lights up amygdala and primal brain
		We start living like surviving (eating all day)
		Loose ability of divergent thinking 
	Get Moving
		Releases BDNF (miracle growth)
		When body moves, brain grooves
		Resistance training (improves neuroplasticity - the ability of the brain to grow and evolve by creating new cells)
			Includes lifting weights
			2 strength training a week (only select the exercises you love)
			Never skip Leg day! (improves long term memory)
		Walk daily (5-16 mins)
			Increase creativity by 60% (instils divergent thinking) - when we run into problems divergent thinking helps view all possible options/paths clearly
As our waist grows, our brain shrinks because grey matter is lost (responsible for
things like executive functions, muscle control, sensory perception)
Keyword is Added. However healthy diet requires natural sugar (body needs glucose)
	Sources of natural sugar:
		Legumes, Fruits, Some grains
How to Produce Oxytocin:
Simple 20-sec hug (your mom, dad, best friend, nana, cousin)
Where to start? Start with breakfast. Eliminate cereals, muffins, pancakes (sugary stuff), start including veggies (Ex. veg omelette, veg stir fry, green smoothie)
Engage more with community, extended family
Less Memory Problems/ Cognitive decline (Neuroprotective), Improved Learning Ability
Hippo campus vulnerable to chronic stress. Oxytocin protects it.
Brain needs it! Period
Don't consume enough and there's a 70% chance of Alzheimers
Neurons, neurotransmitters, hormones - all water based
Our genes love variety
Hot water with lemon is great
Brain up-to 11 years younger
How much to consume:
	Weight in pounds/2 = ounces to consume daily (MED)
		For a 60 kilo person its about 2 litres
			Whenever in doubt, feel something missing - drink water
			Keep a bottle with you
Majority of brain is fats
Good News: Body can convert ALA into DHA but  Bad news: 75% of Omega 3 is lost in conversion process.
Consider:
	Problem: They provide us with ALA (brain needs EPA / DHA)
	Solution: Algal Oil (Veg DHA), Soyabean Oil
going to events as frequently as we can, meet-ups in your area, Mastermind groups,
hopping on conference calls, webinars
Cyber-loafing: Instead of doing the MIT we flee to tech (YouTube, Facebook)
If you're the smartest person in the room then you're in the wrong room
Not taking care can lead to depression, ADHD
be curious, continue to
be optimistic, ask questions
Lack of sleep diminishes the ability to make choices, a problem in relationships, distinguish between right and wrong, perform executive functions
However 90% of the data involves gut sending commands to the brain
	.
How to protect?
	Avoid processed food (fake foods) diet, bad bacteria love it. Stop feeding them
		Be mindful of the water you drink (less chlorine). Cause chlorine although kills bacteria it can't differentiate between bad and good bacteria {get an RO (Reverse osmosis) system}
			Eat fermented food:
				Resistance starch
					Garlic, Onions
					Beans
					Artichoke
				Pickles
				Yoghurt
				Yakult (probiotic)
Every hour you spend in front of the screen, you suppress melatonin (sleep hormone) for 30 mins
Those who exercised before class improve test scores by 70% while those who exercised for 40 mins prior to test got a grade higher
15% more efficiency
Tips:
	30 Min screen free time
		Don't sit idle though. read, journal talk (UNWIND)
			Get enough sunlight (boost serotonin, suppress cortisol (stress hormone)). Helps boost melatonin
				Change mattress. most of them contain toxic stuff, causing sleep-related pain (get intellibed or chilli-pad)
Support healthy bacteria
