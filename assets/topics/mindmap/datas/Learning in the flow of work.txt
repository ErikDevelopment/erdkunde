		[Case studies from Slack and Udemy](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KvsYPl6r0d68MG0fbrB-orfNQQd9QaAi)
		In flow of work
		Constantly challenged yet capable of moving up the learning curve
		New learners: structured learning (macro)
		More advanced learners: unstructured learning (micro)
			Macro-learning approaches
				Ex: MOOCs, lengthy and in-depth courses to get someone up to a level of comfort and effectiveness
				Best for new learners or people entering into new roles
			Micro-learning approaches
				Add peer feedback for quick engagement
				Micro-learning approaches: retention of operational knowledge: using adaptive learning to refresh and remind people of what they need to know
				Practice: repetition is not enough; practice is needed to reinforce and solidify retention

	Learning
		**The future of learning: [Social Learning](https://youtu.be/X6Zo53M0lcY)**
		**Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory**: Most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling
			1. Attention: Paying attention to the peer or model and the behavior they exhibit
			2. Retention: Recalling the new knowledge or behavior
			3. Reproduction: Modeling or imitating this new skill or behavior
			4. Motivation: Having a good reason to imitate this new skill or behavoir
				**Learning motivation:** the 'why' of the activity - giving people a good reason to do something
					[ARCS Model of Motivational Design (Keller): ](https://www.learning-theories.com/kellers-arcs-model-of-motivational-design.html)
						Attention: grab learners attention
							Active participation: games, role play, engagement
							Variability: variety of methods in presenting material
							Incongruity and conflict
							Humor: small amount is good
							Specific examples: storytelling, visuals, etc.
							Inquiry, problems to solve: eg brainstorming
						Relevance: use concrete language and examples 
							Choice: allow learners to choose own method
							Needs matching: achievement, risk taking, power, affiliation
							Future usefulness: what will this do for me tomorrow?
							Modeling: be what you want them to do!
							Experience: using existing skills
							Present worth: what will the subject do for me today?
						Confidence
							Allow for meaningful success
							Self-efficacy - help learners see their likelihood for success
							Awareness of performance requirements and evaluation criteria from the start
							Feedback
							Learner control: learners should believe that their success is a direct result of the amount of effort they have put forth
							Growth: allow for small steps of growth
						Satisfaction
							Rewarding or satisfying learning
							Opportunities to use knowledge in a real setting makes learners feel that the new skill is useful or beneficial
							Feedback and reinforcement lead to satisfying results
							Do not over-reward easy tasks
					**Build motivation:**
					Give a strong reason: a good WHY
					Show the value of the learning program to each person, personally
					Add to percieved value through contribution: need to pay or use own free time, **made exclusive**, limited enrollment, etc.
					Metrics-focused case studies of success
					Use a mix of positive, negative, internal and external incentives
						Incentives
							*Offered before the action takes place*
							ways to motivate
							usually external, but some incentives can trigger internal rewards
							external incentives can REDUCE motivation because it puts the focus on the outcome instead of the activity
					Use rewards appropriately
						Rewards
							*Result of the behavior*
							prize or benefit
							external: monetary/non-monetary; positive/negative
							internal: feelings of accomplishment, community, or autonomy
		**Learning engagement:** the  'what' of the activity - making sure that the experience itself is enjoyable, challenging, and engaging
			Attention
			Curiosity
			Interest
			Passion
			**Build engagement**
				First impression important: keep logistics smooth, pace flowing
				Use good learning design principles: learner-centric, interactive, clear objectives and explanations, variety in media and activities
				Use tech/platform that is fun and easy to use
				Good content, enough content, variety of content
				Right level of difficulty
