	South Korea 
		Historical context 
			Cold war
				US was scared of the communist, and allied countries changing their loyalty that they were more relaxed on the policies they let pass  
		Policies 
			ownership of outward oriented industrial policies pursued by Korea 
				firms could progressively through creating provisional protective barriers with resources 
					incentive for new creation of new creative industries 
			selective nature 
				industrialised by shifting from ISI to EOI
					transition from primary sector production to secondary sector production of high-skilled technology 
						shift cause two crucial outcomes for Koreas economic growth and trajectory 
							economic diversification
							increased emphasis on research and development 
								dual positive impact- increased resilience of firms to external shocks and exposing secondary sector new technologies to foreign markets (generating greater capital)
		Agrarian reforms 
			had the ability to implement state led reforms where the landlord classes were left behind and tenants were made into owners- STATE CONTROL  
		Neoclassical argument that industrial policy is ineffective 
			South Korea shows the opposite 
			Rostow modernisation argument 
	Chibber (2005) 
		DEBT
			South Korea avoided by switching from ISI to EOI at the right time 
			debt crises for the rest of the world 
		Refutes the general theory
		what the developmental state really does:
			socialisation of the risks of industry development 
			repression of labour classes 
			national monopolies 
		Japanese re-allocation/investment
			upgrade and open markets which didnt happen in other cases than in South Korea 
				control
				FDI 
		ISI to EOI 
			incentive to compete 
			not domestic monopoly 
		Underlying idea of the developmental state 
			state is autonomous from the bourgeoise /// the bourgeoise is weak and takes the role of a junior partner to the state 
				REALITY 
					the relationship between the state and the bourgeoise was not abandoned and/or subordinated  
					national bourgeoise never followed the state policy guidelines 
					state was in fact never made autonomous 
						representatives always present within the state
