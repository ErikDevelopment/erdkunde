**Motivation and Emotion**
	**Approaches to Understanding Motivation**
		**Motivation:** is the process by which activities are started, directed, and continued so that physical or psychological needs or wants are met (Petri, 1996). The word itself comes from the Latin word mover, which means “to move.”
			*extrinsic motivation*
				a person performs an action because it leads to an outcome that is separate from the person (Ryan & Deci, 2000).
			*ntrinsic motivation*
				is the type of motivation in which a person performs an action because the act itself is fun, rewarding, challenging, or satisfying in some internal manner.
		**INSTINCTS AND THE EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH**
			biologically determined and innate patterns of behavior called instincts that exist in both people and animals.
			the human instinct to reproduce is responsible for sexual behavior, and the human instinct for territorial protection may be related to aggressive behavior.
		**APPROACHES BASED ON NEEDS AND DRIVES**
			**Need:** is a requirement of some material (such as food or water) that is essential for survival of the organism.
			**Drive:** When an organism has a need, it leads to a psychological tension as well as a physical arousal that motivates the organism to act in order to fulfill the need and reduce the tension. 
		**DRIVE-REDUCTION THEORY**
			proposes just this connection between internal physiological
			states and outward behavior. 
			*Primary drives*
				are those that involve survival needs of the body such as hunger and thirst
			*Acquired (secondary) drives*
				are those that are learned through experience or conditioning, such as the need for money or social approval, or the need of recent former smokers to have something to put in their mouths.
			*Homeostasis:* tendency of the body to maintain a steady state
	**HUMANISTIC APPROACHES**
		MASLOW’S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
			Several levels of need a person must strive for before reaching self-actualization
				Physiological →safety →love/belonging →esteem →cognitive →aesthetic →self-actualization
			Self-actualization
				point at which people have sufficiently satisfied the lower needs and achieved their full human potential
				Peak experiences
					times in a person’s life during which self-actualization is temporarily achieved
				Transcendence
					search for spiritual meaning beyond one’s immediate self
					Added to original theory much later
		SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY (SDT)
			there are three inborn and universal needs that help people gain a complete sense of self and whole, healthy relationships with others.
				**Autonomy:** need to be in control of one’s own behavior and goals (i.e. self-determination)
				**Competence:** need to be able to master the challenging tasks of one’s life
				**Relatedness:**  need to feel a sense of belonging, intimacy, and security in relationships with others
			Social context of an action has an effect on the type of motivation existing for the action
				Supportive environment increases intrinsic motivation
	￼**AROUSAL APPROACHES**
		*stimulus motive*
			s one that appears to be un- learned but causes an increase in stimulation
			curiosity, playing, and exploration.
		**OPTIMUM AROUSAL**
			In arousal theory, people are said to have an optimal (best or ideal) level of tension. 
			**Yerkes-Dodson law**
				performance is related to arousal
				Moderate levels of arousal lead to better performance than do levels of arousal that are too low or too high
				Effect varies with the difficulty of the task
					Easy tasks require a high-moderate level
					More difficult tasks require a low-moderate level
			Sensation seeker
				one who needs more arousal than the average person
		
		**INCENTIVE APPROACHES**
			things that attract or lure people into action
			*Incentive motivation* 
				Explains behavior as a response to the external stimulus and its rewarding properties
				Shifts focus from internal “pushes” to external “pulls”
			Examples
				Hunger motivates eating by making food more attractive
					Hungry people rate a sugar solution as more pleasant
				Excessive heat makes cold things more appealing
					People who are warm consider cool water to be more pleasant
	**DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS: PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS**
		McClelland’s Theory: Affiliation, Power, and Achievement Needs
			According to McClelland, human beings have a psychological need for friendly social interactions and relationships with others
			**need for affiliation (nAff)**
				people high in this need seek to be liked by others and to be held in high regard by those around them. 
			**need for power (nPow)**
				Power is not about reaching a goal but about having control over other people. 
				People high in this need would want to have influence over others and make an impact on them. 
			**need for achievement (nAch)**
				involves a strong desire to succeed in attain- ing goals, not only realistic ones but also challenging ones. 
		Pesonality and nAch: Carol Dweck's Self-Theory of Motivation
			According to motivation and personality psychologist Carol Dweck (1999), the need for achievement is closely linked to personality factors, including a person’s view of how self (the beliefs a person holds about his or her own abilities and relationships with others) can affect the individual’s perception of the success or failure of his or her actions. 
			is related to the much older notion of locus of control, in which people who assume that they have control over what happens in their lives are consid- ered to be internal in locus of control, and those who feel that their lives are controlled by powerful others, luck, or fate are considered to be external in locus of control
	**Cultural Differences**
		Individualistic cultures
			Focus on the individual as independent and autonomous
			Praise will boost a student’s self-esteem and motivate that student to succeed
		Collectivistic cultures
			Focus on the welfare of the group as whole
			Praise may single out a student and motivate that student to underachieve
	**Eating Disorders  and Obesity**
		*Eating disorders*
			**Anorexia nervosa:** severe undereating
			**Bulimia nervosa:** binging and purging
			**Bing-eating disorder:** frequent overeating
		*Obesity*
			Body weight ≥ 20% over “ideal” body weight for height
				Often measured by body mass index (BMI)
				Weight is NOT a particularly good indicator of health
			Biological causes: heredity, hormones, slowing metabolism with age
			Other causes: overeating, stress
			
	**Drives**
		Regulatory Drives
			Preserve/maintain homeostasis
			Necessary for continued survival
			Example: hunger
		Non-RegulatoryDrives
			May preserve fitness in other ways
			Not necessary for continued survival
			Example: sex
	**Emotion**
		 Sometimes called “affect”
		the “feeling” aspect of consciousness
		Can trigger change in thought or behavior
		Three components of emotion
			Physiological process
				Example: heart beating fast, sweating
			Behavioral response
				Example: eyes and mouth opening wide
			Inner awareness of feelings
				Example: I’m scared!
		**Physiology of Emotion**
			**Sympathetic nervous system**
				Responsible for aspects of physiological arousal
				Some emotions produce similar physiological responses
					Anger / fear →increased heart rate, more rapid breathing
				Others produce different physiological responses
					Disgust →high increases in skin conductance
					Happiness →less change in skin conductance
			Polygraph test (“lie detector”)
				Based on assumption that lying and telling the truth produce different physiological response
				ONLY detects physiological correlates of emotion
					Not admissible evidence of innocence/guilt in US courtrooms
			**Amygdala**
				Complex structure
					Many different nuclei and subdivisions
				Seems to be necessary for fear conditioning
				Two roads to amygdala for emotional stimuli
					“Low road” –faster but more crude (subcortical)
					“High road” –slower but more involved (cortical)
			**Frontal lobes**
				**Left frontal lobe:** associated with positive emotions
				**Right frontal lobe:** associated with negative emotions
	**Hunger**
		Eating is one of our most basic needs
			Some people struggle to eat less
			Some people struggle to eat more
		Hunger influenced by a variety of factors
			Physiological components
			Social components
		**Physiological Components**
			Hormones
				**Insulin:** reduces level of glucose in bloodstream
				**Glucagon:** increases level of glucose in bloodstream
				**Leptin:** signals the hypothalamus that the body has had enough food
					Reduces appetite
					Increases the feeling of being full
			Hypothalamus
				**Lateral hypothalamus (LH):** starts the eating responses when insulin increases
				**Ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH):** stops the eating response when glucose increases
			WEIGHT SET POINT AND BASAL METABOLIC RATE
				weight set point
					Some researchers (Leibel et al., 1995; Nisbett, 1972) believe that the hypothalamus affects the particular level of weight that the body tries to maintain
				basal metabolic rate (BMR)
					The rate at which the body burns energy when a person is resting
		**Social Components**
			Social cues
				Regular meal times
			Food preferences
				Always room for dessert
			Cultural factors
				Sometimes rude to refuse food
			Gender
				Men and women may start/stop eating for different reasons
			Comfort
				Escape from unpleasantness
				Insulin can increase before food is eaten
	**Theories of Emotion**
		Early theories of emotion
			Common sense theory
				Stimulus →experience of an emotion →physiological response
			James-Lange theory
				Stimulus →physiological response →interpretation / labeling of an emotion
			Cannon-Bard theory
				Stimulus →brain activity →physiological response AND interpretation of emotion
		Cognitive theories of emotion
			Facial feedback theory
				Facial expressions provide feedback to brain
				Feedback causes/intensifies emotions
			Schachterand Singer’s cognitive arousal theory
				Stimulus →physiological response AND cognitive labeling of arousal →experience of emotion
			Lazarus’s cognitive-mediational theory
				Stimulus →immediate cognitive appraisal →emotional response →physiological response
